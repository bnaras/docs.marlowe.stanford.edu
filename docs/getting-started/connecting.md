# Connecting

After your project has been approved, connecting is simple!

## SSH

The login server you will need to ssh into is `login.marlowe.stanford.edu`. You will need to ssh in with your SUNet ID.

So, if your SUNet ID was `bob`, your login command would look like:

```
ssh bob@login.marlowe.stanford.edu
```
