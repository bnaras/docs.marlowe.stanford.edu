# Getting Access

Unlike other Stanford HPC resources like Farmshare and Sherlock, Marlowe will require extra steps before being able to gain access to it.

After applying to the review committee, you will receive an [allocation](./allocations.md)

Once that allocation is approved, a project will be created for you and you will be able to log in.
